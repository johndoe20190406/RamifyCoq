HOW TO SET UP YOUR ENVIRONMENT

Our development has been tested using Coq 8.8.1 and the last stable version of VST at the time of our paper submission. This guide helps you set up your environment so you can explore our code.

1. Download and Unpack
1.1. Download Coq version 8.8.1. The following shell command works if using Opam: 
opam install coq.8.8.1
1.2. From the VST Github repository, download the last stable build at the time of submission, i.e. commit c0de4014. Unpack this into your VST folder. The following link provides a direct download:
https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/VST/archive/c0de40144301c301802af680e178a275cae92a1a.zip
1.3. Download RamifyCoq from this GitHub repository and unpack it into your RamifyCoq folder.
NB, it is not necessary for your folders to be named VST and RamifyCoq, although we shall refer to them as such below. You can name them as you wish. 

2. Build VST
2.1. Open "Makefile" within your VST folder and edit line 458, appending "or-else 8.8.1" to the list of acceptable Coq versions.
2.1. In your VST folder, run "make clean".
2.2. Run "make -j3" or "make -j7", depending on how many cores you have.

3. Build RamifyCoq
3.1. In your RamifyCoq folder, create a new file called "CONFIGURE" and put the following two lines in it, with either the absolute or the relative path of the VST folder in place of the portion in [box brackets]
VST_DIR=[path to your VST folder]
COMPCERT_DIR=[path to your VST folder]/compcert
3.2. Run "touch .depend".
3.3. Run "make depend" to create the dependency file.
3.4. Run "make -j3" or "make -j7".

4. Set Up IDE Environment
Still in your RamifyCoq folder, make a new file called "_CoqProject" and put the following three lines in it, again with the usual substitutions for path:
-Q [path to your VST folder]/compcert compcert
-Q [path to your VST folder] VST 
-Q . RamifyCoq
Now IDEs such as ProofGeneral will be able to explore files within RamifyCoq. You are done.
